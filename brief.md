# Brief

## Mockup
// TODO - Add mockup image
<!-- ![Calculator Mockup]('/calculator-mockup.png') -->

## Requirements

1. **Number functionality**:

> *"Users should be able to push each number on the calculator using their mouse and it will display on the header of the calculator."*

2. **Add, minus, divide and multiply**:

> *"Users should be able to enter their operation and be able to perform all of the above actions in order to get the correct result when clicking equals."*

3. **Returning an answer**:

> *"After the user has put in their sum, pressign the `equal` button should then give them the answer. You will update the current displayed sum in the header and display the answer instead."*

4. **Clear and start again**:

> *"Click the `AC` button should give the 'all clear' and clear the header to 0, and remove any background sums, ready to start a new one."*

5. **Save the result**:

> *"When the users clicks the `save` button on the calculator, the sum should be stored in a CSV file, along with the user's IP address, date it was added, and the browser used."*
> *"Create a new page called `Calculations.php`, convert the CSV file into an array, and output all the info into a table. Should be filtered by newest to oldest."*

## Note.
* The design mockup shows the equation also but this is excluded from the written brief.
